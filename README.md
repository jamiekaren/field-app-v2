## Behind AI's Field App 

Jamie Ferrugiaro has worked as a volunteer digital marketer for Amman Imman for over 4 years. She approached the Director, Debbie Khan, about creating an app for them. Debbie and other team members at Amman Imman decided on building an app to assist field nurses in their mobile health programs. Field nurses teach young girls and women health and sanitation practices.

Jamie approached her team from Project 3, whom she create a mock version of the app for their final project. (You can see that version here: https://github.com/jamiekaren/field-app). She invited any team members to continue to work on a improved, new version and help present it during Rutger's Demo Day. Two members of the original team, Jasmin and Will, agreed to continue their work on the app for the charity in order to pursue the challenge of improving the app before the presentation event in December. 

### Field App Version 2 (Second Version)

### Field App Version 1 (Original Version) 

Previously, Jasmin and Will have both worked on some of the logic behind the Trainer page the nurses would use.

Will wrote a lot of the code for the main view of what is deemed the "Trainer's Page", where nurses and field ops first see after logging in. 

Jasmin worked, also aided by Will, on logic when the lesson for this page as well, incorporating using tenary operators.

Jamie worked on setting state in their Trainer page component for when a lesson was selected (clicked on), as well as working with Mark on the React Slide npm package the team incorporated as a new technology into the application.
