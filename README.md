## Behind AI's Field App 

Jamie Ferrugiaro has worked as a volunteer digital marketer for Amman Imman for over 4 years. She approached the Director, Debbie Khan, about creating an app for them. Debbie and other team members at Amman Imman decided on building an app to assist field nurses in their mobile health programs. Field nurses teach young girls and women health and sanitation practices.

Jamie approached her team from Project 3, whom she create a mock version of the app for their final project. (You can see that version here: https://github.com/jamiekaren/field-app). She invited any team members to continue to work on a improved, new version and help present it during Rutger's Demo Day.

Jasmin and Will agreed to come on board. Previously, Jasmin and Will have both worked on some of the logic behind the Trainer page the nurses would use.

## Field App: Functionality
